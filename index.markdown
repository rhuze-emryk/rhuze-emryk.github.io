# Please Don't Make Me Install Linux

*A guide for the reluctant, the confused, and those looking for practical solutions.*

You've heard Linux is powerful but installation feels overwhelming. Perhaps you've been told to "just use the terminal" and now you're questioning your choices. I've been there, and that's exactly why this site exists.

I'm documenting what I've learned about Atomic Linux distributions (sometimes called immutable distributions) – the practical benefits, the real challenges, and solutions to common problems. This is Linux without unnecessary jargon or the assumption that you already know how everything works.
