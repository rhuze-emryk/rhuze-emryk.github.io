# About Me

Hi! I'm Rich Hughes — father, multipotentialite, tech super nerd, AI/LLM expert, top 10 restaurant reviewer on Google Maps, photgrapher with 5 million+ views on Google Maps, music reviewer and obsessive. Recent bird admirerer. I created this site to share what I've learned about Atomic Linux distributions to save you various pains in the asses I have ran into.
